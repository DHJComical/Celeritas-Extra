# Celeritas Extra

A comprehensive backport that includes [Embeddium(Rubidium)Extra](https://github.com/embeddedt/rubidium-extra) and various other features to Minecraft 1.12.2

This is a project I started as a beginner learning Java for practice purposes.
There may be insufficient code and various issues throughout, but forks, pull requests, and issues are welcome.

This mod is still in early development and doesn't have many features implemented yet.
Also, the code is probably very spaghetti.

Note: I'm not confident enough in my code quality to publish this on CurseForge or Modrinth at this time. I tend to be quite self-critical.
